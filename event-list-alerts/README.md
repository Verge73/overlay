Putting this here in case anyone wanted to look through the code for my own on-stream event list and on-stream alerts to figure out how things work. I'm not hosting this publicly, but nothing's stopping you from just taking this and hosting it yourself. (please don't, try making your own!!)

Also, there are bits icons in the icons folder in case anyone's struggling to find those. (you're welcome uwu)

(code is probably pretty nasty in spots, but it works, so whatever)
