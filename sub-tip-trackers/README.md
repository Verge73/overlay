This is my goal trackers for tips/donations and new/gift subs.

I've added functionality for mods (and the broadcaster) to manage the trackers through chat:
```
!goalset [which] [value] -- sets the goal (which) to the specified value (value)
!goaladd [which] [value] -- adds the value specified (value) to the goal's (which) current value
```

Goals can be added/removed by editing the `goals` object at the top of `main.js`.
